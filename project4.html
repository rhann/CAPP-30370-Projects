	My name is Robert Hann, and I am currently enrolled at the University of Notre Dame. I am a 
Junior pursuing a degree in IT Management from the <b>Mendoza College of Business</b>. After graduation, 
one of my goals is to say <i>Adios!</i> to my years as a student and pursue a career in Information Technology. 
My love and passion for technology and computers has directed my course of study and will likewise shape my 
career. A second goal of mine following graduation is to travel and see a different part of the world. I 
have never been outside of North America, and I would love for the opportunity to live or visit another 
part of the world.
