		<p>
		Joe Toy, on the verge of adolescence, finds himself increasingly frustrated by his single father, Frank's attempts to manage his life. Declaring his freedom once and for all, he escapes to a clearing in the woods with his best friend, Patrick, and a strange kid named Biaggio. He announces that they are going to build a house there, free from responsibility and parents. Once their makeshift abode is finished, the three young men find themselves masters of their own destiny, alone in the woods. Written by A.J. Porter

		Nick grew up in Seattle with his mom, dad and six siblings. At the age of two, he had already developed an eye for the classics. While crawling, his favorite films included "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" and "Davy Crockett."

		When a theater friend suggested Robinson meet and audition for famed talent scout Matt Casella, he and his family jumped at the chance. During a meeting in Los Angeles, Casella liked what he saw in Robinson: "He's a real kid, with an extraordinary talent and gift, not to mention a smart, good natured, creative kid with a great smile. Nick is ready for LA." Casella recommended Robinson to a couple of talent agencies in Los Angeles and The Savage Agency signed him immediately.

		During the summer of 2009, Robinson worked with several acting coaches and began auditioning for television work. His first audition earned him a producer callback, and on his second audition Nick landed the role of Ryder in the series "Melissa & Joey."
